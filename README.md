# Spider-Attack-coding-game
It's a problem solving Hackathon that runs your code over a game and you try to beat the competitors with your code. The more you enhance your code, you got upgraded to higher leagues.</br></br>
I participated in this hackathon in the orange digital center in Egypt which organizes competitive programming hackathons. I got the forth place between my colleagues in the Hackathon.</br></br>

In this Project I applied:</br>
1.OOP concepts</br>
2.Data structure and algorithms concepts</br></br>
